        <h3 id="headline">Evolution of Blockchain in the Web3 Ecosystem:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1991</strong> - Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta had the vision of what we know today as blockchain. Their initial work was to create a cryptographically secured blockchain where no one could tamper with document timestamps.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1992</strong> - They updated their system to incorporate Merkle trees, improving efficiency by allowing more documents to be collected in a single block
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2008</strong> - The history of Blockchain began to gain relevance thanks to the work of a person or group by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto.
Nakamoto is credited as the brain behind blockchain technology. Although very little is known about him, it is believed that he could be a person or group of people who worked on Bitcoin, the first application of digital ledger technology.
Nakamoto conceptualized the first blockchain in 2008, and since then, the technology has evolved and developed into many applications beyond cryptocurrencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2009</strong> - Satoshi Nakamoto released the first report on the technology in 2009, providing details on how this technology was well equipped to improve digital trust due to its decentralized aspect.
            On January 3, 2009, Bitcoin saw the light of day when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block, known as the genesis block. Nakamoto received a reward of 50 bitcoins for this achievement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2010</strong> - The first real-world transactions were made with Bitcoin, such as buying a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins.
            Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman,
            he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
            breeding pest-resistent plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2014</strong> - Ethereum introduced smart contracts, allowing the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2015</strong> - Hyperledger, an open source project to develop blockchain-based business solutions, was formed..
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2017</strong> - The rise of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) drove the adoption of blockchain in projects beyond cryptocurrencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2020</strong> - Blockchain technology was applied in areas such as logistics, digital identity, supply chain management and more
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
            food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the
            only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
            that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
            genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
            before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
          </li>
          <li><strong>2022</strong> - Blockchain technology continued its evolution and had a significant impact in several aspects. Here are some of the key trends:
          NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens):
NFTs became extremely popular in 2022. These are unique digital tokens that represent assets such as art, music, or collectibles.
Blockchain technology enabled the creation, sale and trading of NFTs, revolutionizing the art and digital property industry1.
Cryptocurrencies:
Cryptocurrencies continued to be a hot topic. Bitcoin and Ethereum remained leaders, but new cryptocurrencies such as Solana and Avalanche emerged.
The adoption of cryptocurrencies has expanded, with more companies and people accepting them as a form of payment1.
Integration with IoT (Internet of Things):
The combination of blockchain and IoT became more prominent. Blockchain provides security and transparency for data generated by IoT devices.
This was applied in areas such as supply chain management, logistics and product tracking2.
Blockchain in the Metaverse:
The concept of a metaverse (a shared virtual space) gained ground. Blockchain is used to create digital assets within these virtual worlds.
Games, virtual property and experiences in the metaverse are increasingly based on blockchain technology3</li>
